# Getting started
Welcome to the Horizons End wiki! This page is here to help new players understand the basics of the server so that they can begin creating on the Horizons End server. This guide is completley optional, and you dont have to follow it. Feel free to do whatever you want!

# Downloading the resource pack (OPTIONAL)
Well, before you do anything, You want to download the resource pack which is located at https://github.com/HorizonsEndMC/ResourcePack
After you follow the installation tutorial (Which can be located by scrolling down), You must move the folder inside Resourcepack-main.zip into your resource packs folder, Which you can find by pressing ESC in minecraft, then clicking on "Resource packs"

# Getting to Survival
Firstly, You need to join the server at HorizonsEnd.net, Once you are in the server you will spawn in "limbo", Which is an empty void. to get to survival do /server survival, Or if you want to go to the creative (Building) server you can go to creative by /server creative

## Spawning In
Congratulations, You are in Survival! You will spawn in a station known as Prometheus Station, Which is located in the Asteri system. First you should do /kit starter (Will give you the resources you need to start), and /kit Cheth (Gives you chetherite, which is hyperdrive fuel). After this, You may explore the station, But when you are ready to actually begin go to the Ship Merchant, who will sell you your first spaceship which can be used to traverse the galaxy.
(You can get a ship by right clicking the "Ship Merchant" Npc, This will cost 200C, You start with 3000C)

> # Feeling lost?
> Follow the signs located above you in the station to make your way to the ship merchant, Or you can ask the community for help!

# Navigating the map
To find where you are in space and planets, You can find where you are (Or find somewhere to go!) at https://survival.horizonsend.net/, This link will bring you to an interactive web-map which you all players can use

> # Protip
> You can see where you are in the map by clicking your name on the sidebar, However you must be holding a clock to do so!

# I have a ship! Now what...?
You bought yourself a ship, Good job! Now we head to the planet, and **Now you get to choose where to go**. But firstly, You may be wondering how to control your ship

## Piloting your ship
First off, to control your ship you first need to detect it. You can do this by left clicking on the jukebox at the front-middle of your ship twice with a clock, and then hitting re-detect. Once you have re-detected your ship you can exit the menu by tapping escape (ESC), Then right click on the jukebox to pilot it

> # Protip
> You only need to re-detect your ship when you make changes to it (Adding blocks or removing blocks). Otherwise you only need to right click the jukebox to pilot your ship.

### Small movements
You can move your ship easily by holding the clock and holding shift (Crouch) in the direction you want to go, This is only useful for small movements. (Landing or making precise movements with your ship)

### Turning
You can turn your ship! By piloting your ship and holding a clock, You can press Q (Drop) to turn right, and F (Swap hand) to turn left!
 
### Cruising
Cruising is a a way to make long-distance travel easier, Its mostly useful for traversing planets and getting closer to objects in space. You can cruise by looking in the in the direction you want to go, and typing /cruise. Or you can click on the "Cruise Control" sign.
> You may only cruise in the direction your ship is facing

### Direct Control
Direct control is a very fast method of short-travel, It is generally used when fighting other players in ships. To use direct control, Pilot a ship and type /dc, Once you have done this; your ship may start moving automatically. Do not panic, this is normal. To control the speed you are going, scroll up and down your mouse wheel. Going up will make you go faster, and going down will make you go slower. Your first slot is reverse, and second slot is to stop. To move up/down in direct control, press W (Forward) to go down, and S (Backwards) to go up. You may also use A (left) and D (right) to move slightly left or right. You can also still turn by using the instructions under the turning section. To stop using direct control, you can do /dc again and you will return to normal control.

## Hyperspace Jumping
Hyperspace jumping is the fastest way to get around. Your starting ship comes with a Tier 1 Hyperdrive, and a Basic Navcomputer. To initiate a jump, you need fuel. You got fuel earlier if you did /kit cheth, if you have not done this; Do it now. Once you have chetherite (Hyperdrive fuel), You have to split it between both hoppers in your hyperdrive (At the back of the ship). You can initiate a jump by doing /jump (Planet name OR Coordinates). This will put you in hyperspace, where you just have to wait to get to your destination. You cannot jump when near planets or big space objects, and will actively get pulled out of hyperspace if you cross paths with one in hyperspace. Jumping use up the chetherite in the hoppers, so make sure to fill it up with chetherite if you find some. (You may need to move away from the station to fill up the hoppers with fuel)

# Getting to a Planet
Now that you know the basics of ship movement, you are going to want to get to a planet to setup your base. To get to a planet, you must first find one on the map that you like (You can switch world views by clicking the icons on the sidebar). Then you must move away from the station, otherwise it will pull you out of hyperspace. Once your hyperdrive is fueled, do /jump (planet) to make the jump to the planet you want to go to. If you get pulled out of hyperspace, move away from the object and initiate /jump again. If you run out of fuel you can just cruise to the planet you want by looking at the map and moving towards the planet using /cruise.

# What next?
Heres a list of things you can do next!

## Make or Join a settlement
You can make a settlement! This works similarly to the factions/towny systems you may already know. Settlements cost a lot of money to make first, So you may need help from some friends to claim an area. Claims work by claiming a specific area of a map, You can see claimable areas on the map. If you dont want to have your own settlement, you can ask around to join somebodies settlement, and they may help you.

## Cargo trade
You can go to certain "Trade Cities" on the map, if you go to a planet and click on the territories, One should have a territory ending in -ost, this signifies that this is a trade city. Once at a trade city, you have to buy crates to transport to other trade cities (By finding the "Exporter" NPC). When you gain a crate, it will tell you where it needs to go, Bring the crate there and right click on the Importer NPC to get a reward!

> ## Important Information
> Cargo Crates can only be placed on sticky pistons, If you do not put them on sticky pistons you drop all crates when flying!

## Anything else!
You can pirate other players, Mine for ores, and much more! You can look at other pages of the wiki for more specific information on a subject. Have fun!
